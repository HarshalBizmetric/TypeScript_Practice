# TypeScript_Practice

There are 2 types of languages, Statically Typed and Dynamically Typed

Statically Typed:
Types of the variable is checked at compile-time as it is predeclared.
eg. Java, C++, C#

Dynamically Typed:
Type of the variable is not checked before running the application, as it is not declared.
After running the application, unit testing we are able to catch type mismatches.
eg. Python, Ruby, JavaScript

That's why TypeScript came into picture, which is built on top of JavaScript which checks the type of the variables/objects.

TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript with Type Checking.
